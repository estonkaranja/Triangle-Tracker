Triangle-tracker.

### Aplication Description
This is an application which detects the type of triangles.This can be either an Equilateral triangle, Isosceles triangle or a Scalene triangle. When a user inputs different measurement, conditions have to met for it to determine if those measurements entered can form a triangle. This applicatipon caanot accept strings i.e. it cannot accept letters as letters cannot form triangle so the application will return an error.
This returns:

| All sides are equal                       | SideA=sideB=SideC         | Equilateral Triangle |
| Two sides are equal                       | sideA=10,SideB=10,SideC=8 | Isocseles triangle   |
| None of the sides is equal                | SideA=10,SideB=8,SideC=6  | Scalene Triangle     |
| Two sides are greater than the third side | SideA=8,sideB=6,SideC=3   | Scalene Triangle     |
| Two sides less than the third side        | SideA=4,sideB=3,SideC=9   | Not a triangle       |
